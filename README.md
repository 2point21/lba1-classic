# Little Big Adventure 1 - Engine source code
Little Big Adventure (aka Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure) is an action-adventure game, developed by Adeline Software International in 1994. 

We are releasing this code with preservation in mind, as this piece of work was exceptional for the time and we believe it can be a valuable source of education.

The engine uses Assembly code and was originally compiled with non-open source libraries which have been excluded from the project.
